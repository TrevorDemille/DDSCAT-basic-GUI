# DDSCAT-basic-GUI
Despite being a wonderful tool for optics/plasmonics simulation techniques, 
DDSCAT is notoriously difficult to use due to its lack of UI. So, I've decided to build one. 
#
This is meant to streamline the writing ddscat.par parameter files, basic analysis of results such as plotting and exporting,
and to make the entire enterprise of using DDSCAT more accessible.
#
This is built using the simple python libraries of Tkinter, for python 2.7
#
Be sure to have the files listed under "Default Files" folder, and to change the directory for the basepath in the python scripts to match your own directories!
Enjoy!
